# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException Bug in Java

This repository demonstrates a common bug in Java programming: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. This exception occurs when you try to access an array element using an index that is out of the array's valid range (0 to array.length - 1).

The `Bug.java` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index.

The `BugSolution.java` file provides a corrected version of the code, which avoids the exception.

This example is useful for illustrating the importance of carefully checking array indices and understanding the valid bounds of array access.
